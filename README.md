# Fitness Buddy : Your friend guiding you towards a healthier life.

## About

Nowadays, we always find ourselves in a hurry, so much so that we forget to take care of ourselves and our health.
That's why it could be helpful to have mobile apps that guide us along our health journey.
Fitness Buddy is a health tracker allowing you to keep track of your daily steps, daily calories and water intake,
and a lot more.

## Features

The android app lets you:
- Track the number of steps taken each day and set the number of steps to be reached.
- Track changes in weight, calorie intake and amount of water intake.
- Calculate BMI and BMR.
- Create an account and personalize your profile.
- Authenticate accounts using Firebase.
- Allow the user to log in using their Gmail or Facebook account.
